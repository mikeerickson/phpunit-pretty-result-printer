# CD PHPUnit Pretty Result Printer 
#### Version 0.26

Extend the default PHPUnit Result Printer with a modern, pretty printer!

[PHPUnit Pretty Result Printer -- Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/codedungeon/phpunit-result-printer)

## Installation

Installation is provided via composer and can be done with the following command, the current version requires PHP 7.1 or greater:

```bash
$ composer require --dev codedungeon/phpunit-result-printer
```

### Execute Initialization Script (Optional)
The following steps are optional, but will provide zero configuration for implementing **phpunit-pretty-result-printer**

- Adds `printerClass="Codedungeon\PHPUnitPrettyResultPrinter\Printer"` to `phpunit.xml` file
- Copies default `phpunit-printer.yml` to project root for easier customization


```bash
$ php ./vendor/codedungeon/phpunit-result-printer/src/init.php
```

#### Manual Configuration
Alternately, if you wish to configure **phpunit-pretty-result-printer** manually, you will need to update your `phpunit.xml` file as follows

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <phpunit printerClass="Codedungeon\PHPUnitPrettyResultPrinter\Printer">
    // ....
  </phpunit>
```

Or from Command-Line:

```bash
$ phpunit --printer=Codedungeon\\PHPUnitPrettyResultPrinter\\Printer
```

### Laravel 5.3 with PHP version 7.0.x

If you are using PHP 7.0.x, you will need to use a compatible version of PHPUnit Result Printer (version 0.8.x)

```bash
$ composer require --dev codedungeon/phpunit-result-printer:^0.8
```

### AnyBar Integration

If you have AnyBar installed, it will be enabled by default.  You can disable using `cd-printer-anybar-enabled` option (see below)

[https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar](https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar)

**Anybar is off by default, thus you will need to set the `cd-printer-anybar` option in the `phpunit-printer.yml` to `true` if you wish to use Anybar.  
This has been done to address issues with using CI tools such as travis (please see [Issue 122](https://github.com/mikeerickson/phpunit-pretty-result-printer/issues/122) for details) **

_NOTE: AnyBar is only available with PHPUnit 7.1 or greater.  
If you need support for previous versions, please let us know.  We are slowly deprecating versions before 7.1._

### Configuration Options

* Create a `phpunit-printer.yml` file in your application root to override default (or anywhere use up the parent tree. It will search recursively up the tree until a configuration file is found. If not found, default configuration will be used).
The following options are available (along with their default values):

#### Options ####

| **Property Name** | **Default** | **Description**
| ------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `cd-printer-hide-class` | false | Hides the display of the test class name
| `cd-printer-simple-output`| false | Uses the default PHPUnit markers (but still uses Printer)
| `cd-printer-show-config`| true | Show path to used configuration file
| `cd-printer-hide-namespace`| true |Hide test class namespaces (will only show print class name)
| `cd-printer-anybar`| true |Enable AnyBar (if anybar is not installed, settings will be ignored)
| `cd-printer-anybar-port`| 1738 |Define AnyBar port number
| `cd-printer-dont-format-classname`| false |Show entire classname or not

#### Markers ###
You can customize the markers which are used for `success`, `fail`, `error`, `skipped`, `incomplete` by modifying the `phpunit-printer.yml` file.

| **Marker** | **Value** *
|---------------|----------| 
| cd-pass | "✔ " |
| cd-fail | "✖ " |
| cd-error | "⚈ " |
| cd-skipped | "→ " |
| cd-incomplete | "∅ " |
| cd-risky | "⌽ " |

_* Notice space after each marker.  This makes the output a little more visually appealing, thus keep that in mind when creating your own custom markers_
